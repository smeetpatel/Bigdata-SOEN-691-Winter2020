# Bigdata-SOEN-691-Winter2020
This repository holds the code for "Human Activity Recgonition" system developed as the project component of SOEN 691 ("Big Data Analytics" - Winter 2020) course held at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.

## Abstract
We aim at recognizing human activity being carried out based on the information collected from the smartphones. Human activity recognition has been an active field of research since quite a time owing to the wide array of its applications. Applications of human activity recognition involve active and assisted living systems for smart homes, healthcare monitoring applications, monitoring and surveillance systems for indoor and outdoor activities, and tele-immersion applications. We will be aiming to recognize the human activity based on the data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in smartphones devices. We will be using the data collected from a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years performing six activities namely walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. We will be using this multivariate timeseries data to classify the performed activity amongst the aformenetioned six activities. This task will be performed utilizing the Apache Spark framework, dask, and scikit-learn library. The technology stack used might alter as the project proceeds.
